In this programming exercise, youâ€™ll get experience with some of the algorithms discussed . You are provided several files:

* [search.py](search.py) contains the search algorithms and necessary data structures.
* [problem.py](problem.py) contains the definition of a few problems, such as N-Queens, 8-Puzzle, and Travel.
* [example_test.py](example_test.py) has a few examples on how to run these search algorithms.
* [example_output.txt](example_output.txt) is the output of running example-test.py.
* [run.py](run.py) is a skeleton code for replicating output
  

 tasks completed are:

1. implementation of `breadth_first_search` in search.py. 
1. implementation of `depth_first_search` in search.py. 
1. implementation of `astar_search` in search.py. Hint: see the implementations of `uniform_cost_search` and `greedy_best_first_search`.
